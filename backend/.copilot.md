You are helping build a hackathon backend using Python and FastAPI.

STRICT RULES:
- Follow a simple, MVP-first approach
- Do NOT overengineer
- Do NOT introduce Celery, Redis, Kafka, or external queues
- Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks for async jobs
- Use in-memory job storage (dictionary)
- Use filesystem storage for files and outputs
- Code must be readable and easy to explain to judges

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Backend framework: FastAPI
- Each file upload creates a background job
- Jobs track: status, progress, current_step, errors
- Errors must be captured per row and streamed in real time
- Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time error streaming
- Bad data should NOT stop the pipeline

FOLDER STRUCTURE:
- app/api → API routes
- app/services → parsing, normalization, filtering, noise removal, validation
- app/jobs → job store and worker
- app/utils → helpers
- storage/uploads → raw files
- storage/outputs → clean output
- storage/errors → error reports

CODING GUIDELINES:
- Prefer functions over classes
- Add small inline comments
- No unnecessary abstractions
- One responsibility per file
- Fail gracefully and log errors
- Keep functions short and readable

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Generate only relevant code
- Follow the existing project structure
- Assume this is a 24–48 hour hackathon project
